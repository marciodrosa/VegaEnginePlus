Vega SDK
==================

2D game engine for mobile devices made with C++ and LUA.

(Earlier, I had named it "Vega Engine Plus", so some files can appear with this name, but it is a deprecated alias.)

-------------------------------

Folder structure explanation:

- src: C++ source files
- include: C++ header files
- unit_test: unit tests for the Lua scripts
- samples: C++ header and source files for samples
- vega_lua: VegaEngine Lua scripts
- android, ios, windows: projects, libraries and binaries for each platform (main project, unit tests and samples)
